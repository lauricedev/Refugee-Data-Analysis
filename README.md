3. What are the countries of origin for the majority of asylum claims made in Canada?
4. What is the total number of asylum claims made in Canada every year?
5. What are the general trends in refugee and asylum statistics from 2012-2022?

## Important Distinction: Refugees vs. Asylum Seekers

**The 1951 Refugee Convention defines a refugee as:** “A person who, owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country”.
> - In this data set, UNHCR-Refugees refers to people who have been resettled to Canada, and arrive to the country as permanent residents.
    
**An asylum seeker (or claimant) on the other hand is defined as** someone who is seeking international protection but has not yet been granted refugee status. 
> - In this data set, asylum-seeker refers to someone who has arrived in Canada as a visitor, worker, student, etc., through official or unofficial ports of entry, and who applied for protection from within Canada (after arrival).
